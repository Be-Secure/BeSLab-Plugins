### What is BeSLab-Plugin ?
A BeSLab-Plugin is a specialized BeS environment script designed to extend the functionality of a centrally hosted BeSLab. It allows you to install and integrate open-source or proprietary utilities, applications, or services into your BeSLab environment. This enables you to leverage these additional tools within your BeS playbooks, expanding the capabilities of your BeSLab.

### What does a BeSLab-Plugin do?
A BeSLab-Plugin introduces new BeS environment variables. These variables provide the necessary information to access and utilize the installed tools or services within your BeS playbooks. By defining these variables, you can seamlessly incorporate the extended capabilities of the plugin into your automation workflows.
 
### How is a BeSLab-Plugin different from a standard BeS Environment Script?
While both BeSLab-Plugins and standard BeS Environment Scripts are used to manage software installations and configurations, BeSLab-Plugins have unique features:
- Additional Functions: BeSLab-Plugins require two extra functions:
    - init(): Exports and lists the BeS environment variables contributed by the plugin.
    - plugininfo(): Provides information about the BeS environment variables.
- Naming Convention: BeSLab-Plugins use a different file extension (.plugin) to distinguish them from standard BeS Environment Scripts.
 
### How to test a BeSLab-Plugin?
To test a BeSLab-Plugin, follow these steps:
1. Create a BeS Environment TestScript: Write a test script to verify if the BeS environment variables are initialized correctly.
2. Invoke Installation and Initialization: Use besman to invoke the install and init functions of the BeS Environment.
3. Validate Environment Variables: Call the assert function on plugininfo() to ensure that the BeS environment variables are set as expected.
By following these steps, you can effectively test the functionality and correctness of your BeSLab-Plugins.
